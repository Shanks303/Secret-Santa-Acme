# Secret Santa Acme

A Python-based Secret Santa assignment system for Acme. This project automates the process of assigning Secret Santas by reading employee data from CSV files, ensuring that:

- No employee is assigned to themselves.
- No employee receives the same assignment as in the previous year.
- Each employee is paired exactly once.
